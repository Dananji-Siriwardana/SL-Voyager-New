Even as a traveler who often purposefully seeks them out, their density on this island was remarkable. Most concentrate around the royal city of Kandy. The term ""Cultural Triangle"" was coined to denote the popular tourist routes. The three corners of the triangle are Kandy's Temple of Sacred Tooth, the Sacred City of Anuradhapura, and the Ancient City of Polonnaruwa. All three cities are about two hours apart from one another. Right at the center of this triangle are two additional sites: the Fortress of Sigiriya and the Golden Temple of Dambulla.","According to the legend and historical records, Sigiriya was inhabited in pre-historic times. Perhaps not surprisingly, the unworldly geography of this place has been attractive to many through the millennium. It is known that Buddhist monks occupied part of Sigiriya as early as the 3rd century B.C.E. But what made Sigiriya what it is was the works of King Kashyapa I of Anuradhapura. Why this precarious location, you might ask? In the middle of the fifth century, King Kashyapa, an illegitimate child, actually ascended to the throne after the violent overthrow of his father. Fearing the reprisal from the legitimate heir, who had fled to southern India, King Kashyapa took up the residence at the much more defensible Sigiriya. Much of the ruins we see nowadays were built during his 22-year reign. Ironically, the king met his fateful end on the battlefield against the legitimate half-brother, the future King Moggallana I."
